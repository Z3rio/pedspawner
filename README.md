# Pedspawner
Are you tired of shitty ped spawners that barely work?
<br>
Look no further, this is a pedspawner made to work with QB-Core and supports basically anything that you might want to do.

# Usage:
Simply do /createped and it will bring up a menu to create a ped.

# Other commands:
/clearpeds - Removes all peds
<br>
/removeped [index] - Removes the ped with the specified index
<br>
/togglepedids - Shows all the indexes for peds nearby
